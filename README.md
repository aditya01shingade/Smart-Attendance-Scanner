# smart_attendance_scanner
A new Flutter project.
Smart Attendance Scanner - system using Flutter and Excel. Teachers select a session (Department, Semester, Subject), then students scan their QR codes to mark attendance. The app records each student's presence with date and time into an Excel file. It prevents duplicate scans, auto-marks absent students at session end, and supports monthly tracking. Final Excel sheets show detailed attendance with Present, Absent counts and percentage per student.
